musicbrainz-dataviz
-------------------

Repository to store bits of code playing with the [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) database, mostly with python/pandas, and testing javascript visualization libraries (visjs, d3js?).

The repo will probably contain Jupyter notebooks centered around the different MusicBrainz entities (artists, works, recordings, series...) and giving examples of SQL queries to extract important data.

The entry point for the original notebook versions is [here](./index.ipynb), the
one for static HTML pages is [there](https://loujine.github.io/musicbrainz-dataviz/0-introduction.html).

Other notebooks will look into the history of edits (artist activity, edits using userscripts, etc.)
